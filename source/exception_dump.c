/* Minimal libnx user-exception handler for the IB3 runtime.
 *
 * Two jobs:
 *  1. Service permission faults on executable guest mappings (the runtime's
 *     code cache is mapped RWX; Horizon only allows RW or RX, so
 *     ib3_handle_exec_fault() flips the mapping and the access is retried).
 *  2. Log anything else and panic, using only the already-open debug log.
 *
 * Resuming: the first attempt is the kernel's own svcReturnFromException(0).
 * In the previous test log that call was answered with a bad-SVC exception
 * (esr = svc #0x28), so this build detects that case and switches to a manual
 * resume: it rebuilds every general register from the saved exception dump and
 * branches back itself. A branch needs a register that already holds the
 * target, so this works directly only for instruction fetches (a jump into a
 * chunk that has just been made executable: the jump register already holds
 * the address). A faulting store is instead re-executed from a small stub
 * (ib3_store_stub) placed within branch range of the store: the resume code
 * jumps to the stub through x17, and the stub restores x17, repeats the
 * store and branches (directly) to the next instruction.
 *
 * SIMD/FP state: the kernel's exception dump carries only GPRs, and the C code
 * that runs here (ib3_handle_exec_fault, ib3_deliver_signal, newlib memset,
 * compiler-generated struct copies) freely uses v0-v31. Without care the
 * interrupted thread resumes with clobbered vector registers. libib3's stub
 * emitter loads a 2-instruction template into d0, then stores it after a store
 * that faulted on an RX chunk, so every thunk built right after a chunk flip
 * came out with zeroed ldr/br words (SIGILL at "stub:+[NSArray array]").
 * __libnx_exception_handler is therefore an assembly entry that saves
 * v0-v31/fpcr/fpsr into a per-thread slot before any C runs, and every resume
 * path restores them just before returning to the guest. */
